%I orginally did the forward Euler Manually but rewatching the lecture
%notes, it said I should include as many functions as possible so I made it
%a function,
function [t, x, y] = forwardEuler(a, b, dt, T)
%Setting up the variables that I will need to preform the forward euler
    t = 0:dt:T;

    %Initalsing the column vectors that my values will be in
    x = zeros(size(t));
    y = zeros(size(t));
    %Initialising the intial conditions
    x(1) = 1;
    y(1) = 1;
    %Actual Forward Euler Scheme
    for i = 1:(length(t)-1)
        x(i+1) = x(i) + dt*(-y(i) + a*x(i)*(x(i)^2 + y(i)^2) + b*(x(i)^2 + y(i)^2));
        y(i+1) = y(i) + dt*(x(i) + a*y(i)*(x(i)^2 + y(i)^2));
    end
